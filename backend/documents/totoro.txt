My Neighbor Totoro: English Synopsis

Synopsis

In the early summer of the early 1950s, Satsuki, a young elementary school girl, her younger sister Mei, and their father move to the countryside to be closer to their mother, who is hospitalized. They choose a home in a rural area with fresh air, near the hospital.

While exploring their new, old house, Satsuki and Mei discover numerous small, black, soot-like creatures called "Susuwatari" (dust bunnies). Their neighbor, an old woman, tells them that these creatures are harmless and visible only to children, disappearing when people move in. Kanta, the old woman's grandson, brings them a treat but teases Satsuki by calling their house a "haunted house." The family begins their new life in the countryside.

In June, during a break from school for rice planting, the family visits their mother in the hospital. Satsuki and Mei tell her about their new "haunted" house. Worried that their mother might be afraid of ghosts, they are relieved when she says she'd love to meet one. The sisters hope for her quick recovery and return home.

One day, while playing alone in the yard, Mei encounters two small, mysterious creatures carrying acorns. Following them, she reaches a large camphor tree in the neighboring forest. There, she discovers a deep hole at the base of the tree and finds an acorn inside. As she tries to retrieve it, she falls into the hole and finds herself in a spacious area where a much larger creature is sleeping. When the creature awakens, Mei asks its name. Its mumbled reply sounds like "Totoro" to her. Mei eventually falls asleep on Totoro's belly and is later found sleeping in the bushes between the yard and the forest by Satsuki. When Mei tries to show Totoro to Satsuki and her father, they can't find it. Their father gently explains that Totoro might be the guardian of the forest and that they cannot always see him. They visit the camphor tree and formally greet Totoro, hoping for his continued protection. That night, Satsuki writes about the encounter in a letter to her mother, expressing her own desire to meet Totoro.

During the rainy season, Satsuki takes Mei to the neighbor's house before going to school. However, Mei misses her sister and the old woman brings her to the school. Satsuki gets permission from her teacher to keep Mei in the classroom for the remaining lessons. On their way home, it starts to rain heavily. They take shelter under a small shrine, but the rain doesn't stop. Kanta passes by and silently offers them his umbrella. Hesitant to take it, Satsuki refuses, but Kanta leaves the umbrella and runs away in the rain. Satsuki realizes that Kanta might be a kind boy after all.

At dusk, Satsuki goes to the nearest bus stop to meet her father, who went to the university without an umbrella. They wait for a long time, and Mei falls asleep. Suddenly, the large Totoro appears beside them. Feeling sorry for the drenched Totoro, Satsuki lends him her father's umbrella. Totoro seems to enjoy the sound of raindrops on the umbrella. He gives them a package of tree seeds wrapped in bamboo leaves as a thank-you gift and leaves on a cat-shaped bus called the "Catbus." Upon returning home, they plant the seeds, but they don't sprout immediately.

One moonlit night in July, Satsuki and Mei wake up to find Totoro and his companions walking around the garden where they planted the seeds. They join Totoro in a magical ritual, and the seeds sprout and grow into a giant tree in an instant. The large Totoro spins a magical top and takes Satsuki, Mei, and the other Totoros on a flight through the air. They land on a branch of the giant tree and play ocarinas. Their father hears the music from his study.

The next morning, the giant tree is gone, but many small sprouts have appeared in the garden. Satsuki and Mei rejoice, realizing that it wasn't just a dream.

During summer vacation in August, while harvesting vegetables with the old woman, Kanta brings a telegram from the hospital. Sensing something is wrong with their mother, Satsuki calls her father at the university and learns that their mother's condition has worsened, delaying her discharge. When Satsuki tells Mei, she throws a tantrum, and they have a big fight. However, Satsuki breaks down in tears in front of the old woman, revealing her own fear and anxiety about possibly losing her mother.

As the sun sets, Mei, still upset, decides to take some corn to the hospital on her own and gets lost. The villagers search for her but can't find her. Desperate, Satsuki goes to the camphor tree to ask Totoro for help. Seeing Satsuki's despair, the large Totoro comforts her and summons the Catbus. Satsuki rides the Catbus and quickly finds Mei, who is crying and lost. They reconcile, and Mei reveals that she wanted to bring corn to their mother.

At night, the Catbus takes them to the hospital. They see their mother talking with their father, looking much better. Relieved that their mother is not going to die, they watch from a treetop. Their mother senses their presence and looks towards the window. There, she finds the corn that Mei brought, with the words "To Mom" carved on the leaves.

The Catbus takes Satsuki and Mei home, where they meet Kanta and the old woman. They walk home together. The Totoros are playing their ocarinas on the camphor tree again. The ending shows scenes of the mother's discharge from the hospital and the changing seasons of autumn and winter.
