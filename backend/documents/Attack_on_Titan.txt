Attack on Titan: The Fall of Humanity and the Rise of Eren Yeager

The Premise:

Humanity teeters on the brink of extinction due to the sudden appearance of humanoid giants known as "Titans." The surviving humans have retreated behind a massive triple-walled fortress consisting of Wall Maria, Wall Rose, and Wall Sina, securing a precarious existence for a hundred years.

The Fall of Wall Maria (Volume 1):

Eren Yeager, a young boy living in the Shiganshina District, which protrudes from the southern edge of Wall Maria, lives with his doctor father Grisha, his mother Carla, and his adopted sister Mikasa Ackerman. Eren dreams of joining the Survey Corps, a military branch dedicated to exploring the outside world, despite the high mortality rate associated with their expeditions. His mother and Mikasa oppose his desire, but Eren continues to share his dreams of venturing beyond the walls with his close friend Armin Arlert.

In the year 845, when Eren is 10 years old, a colossal Titan, towering over the walls, suddenly appears and breaches the gate of Shiganshina District, allowing a horde of Titans to invade. Another Titan, the "Armored Titan," breaks through Wall Maria, forcing humanity to abandon the outermost wall and retreat to Wall Rose. Witnessing his mother being devoured by a Titan, Eren loses his home, dreams, and everything dear to him. Fueled by a burning desire to eradicate the Titans, he enlists in the 104th Training Corps along with Mikasa and Armin.

The Battle of Trost District (Volumes 1-3):

Five years after the fall of Shiganshina and three years after joining the Training Corps, in 850, Eren, now a trainee, is maintaining the stationary cannons in Trost District when the Colossal Titan reappears. The gate is breached again, unleashing another wave of Titans, plunging Trost District into chaos. Unfortunately, the experienced Survey Corps is away on an expedition, leaving the garrison and the 104th Training Corps graduates to defend the district.

Eren is assigned to the same squad as Armin, but their fellow squad members are wiped out, and Eren is seemingly devoured by a Titan while saving Armin. Armin joins other 104th trainees, and Mikasa, who has resolved a crisis at an evacuation point, arrives. Learning about the apparent demise of Eren and the rest of their squad, the trainees are devastated. Mikasa maintains a facade of composure, urging her comrades to fight, but her grief over Eren's loss eventually overwhelms her, putting her in danger. As she fights for survival, fueled by her devotion to Eren, a "Titan-killing Titan" appears. Following Armin's plan, which utilizes the rogue Titan, the trainees successfully escape to a safe zone. The "Titan-killing Titan" collapses after the battle, but as its body evaporates, Eren emerges from the nape of its neck, defying his presumed death.

Fearful of Eren's newfound power, the Garrison attempts to eliminate him, along with Armin and Mikasa who protect him. However, Armin's eloquent plea during the interrogation catches the attention of Commander Pixis, sparing their lives. Pixis adopts Armin's idea to use Eren's Titan form to seal the breached gate with a large boulder and orders the entire military to support Eren. However, upon transforming, Eren loses control and collapses, unconscious.
