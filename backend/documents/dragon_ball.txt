Son Goku's Journey: A Summary

Early Adventures:

Son Goku, a tailed boy living deep in the remote mountains of Earth, encounters Bulma, a girl from the western city. She tells him about the Dragon Balls, seven magical orbs that summon the dragon Shenron, who grants one wish. Goku learns that the four-star ball he inherited from his adoptive grandfather, Gohan, is one of them. Together, Goku and Bulma embark on a journey to find the remaining Dragon Balls. Their adventure involves encounters with a shapeshifting pig named Oolong, a bandit named Yamcha, and the villainous Pilaf gang who seek to conquer the world using the Dragon Balls. Goku and his friends thwart Pilaf's plan by having Oolong make a silly wish when Shenron is summoned.

Goku then trains for eight months under Master Roshi, a martial arts expert, alongside his future best friend Krillin. To test their skills, they participate in the World Martial Arts Tournament. Goku loses in the finals to Roshi, who is disguised, but earns second place. Goku continues his training journey, facing the Red Ribbon Army who aim to misuse the Dragon Balls, training with Korin the mystical cat, reuniting with his grandfather's spirit, and growing stronger. Three years later, in the next World Martial Arts Tournament, Goku fights Tien Shinhan, a rival from the Crane School, but loses narrowly, again achieving second place.

The Piccolo Daimao Saga:

After the tournament, Piccolo Daimao, a powerful demon resurrected by Pilaf, kills Krillin, Roshi, and other martial artists. Seeking revenge, Goku drinks the Ultra Divine Water, a mystical liquid that unlocks his potential at the cost of his life, with the help of Yajirobe and Korin. He confronts and defeats Piccolo Daimao. To revive Shenron and his fallen friends, Goku travels to the Heavenly Realm and meets Kami, the creator of the Dragon Balls. As a condition for Shenron's revival, Goku agrees to train under Kami.

Three years later, now a young man, Goku reunites with his friends at the World Martial Arts Tournament. He marries Chi-Chi, the Ox-King's daughter, whom he had promised to marry in his childhood. In the final match, he battles Piccolo Jr., the reincarnation of Piccolo Daimao, and emerges victorious, claiming his first World Martial Arts Tournament championship.

The Saiyan Saga:

Five years later, Goku, now a father to his son Gohan, enjoys a peaceful life until Raditz, his older brother, arrives from space. Raditz reveals that Goku is a Saiyan, a warrior race from Planet Vegeta. To rescue his kidnapped son, Goku joins forces with his former enemy Piccolo and sacrifices himself to defeat Raditz. However, they learn that even stronger Saiyans will arrive on Earth in a year, seeking the Dragon Balls.

Goku trains under King Kai in the Other World while he waits to be revived. He returns to Earth to face Nappa and Vegeta, the Saiyan invaders. Goku easily defeats Nappa with his newfound power and engages in a fierce battle with Vegeta. With the help of his friends, Goku narrowly wins and forces Vegeta to retreat. However, the battle results in the death of many friends, including Piccolo, which also leads to the death of Kami, who was linked to Piccolo. Consequently, the Earth's Dragon Balls vanish.
